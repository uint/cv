# Tomasz Kurcz - CV
This is my personal CV. It is based on [this lovely LaTeX template](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).

## CD
I use GitHub Actions to build a `.pdf` on every push to `master`. The release is always tagged `latest`. You can find the artifact in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/uint/cv/releases).

Go ahead and copy the workflow if you have any use for it! All the CD stuff is in [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows).
